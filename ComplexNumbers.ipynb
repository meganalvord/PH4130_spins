    "# Python can handle complex numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The models in quantum mechanics require the use of **complex numbers**. These are numbers that involve $j = \\sqrt{-1}$, which your students might have seen previously in a mathematics course. (You and your students likely used $i$ instead of $j$, but Python uses `j` becuase it is an engineering convention, so we'll keep this worksheet consistent by using $j$.) If you haven't worked with complex numbers in a while, the links below will help you refresh on the topic, but here are the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **complex number** $z$ can be written as $z = x + jy$. We call $x$ the **real part** of $z$ and $y$ the **imaginary part** of $z$.\n",
    "* Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. So, if $z_1 = z_2$, then $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$.\n",
    "* Every complex number $z$ has a **complex conjugate**. The complex conjugate $z^*$ is the number with an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. The complex conjugate of $z = x + jy$ is $z^* = x - j y$.\n",
    "* Every complex number has a **modulus** $|z|$, defined as $|z| = \\sqrt{z^* z}$, which is equivalent to $|z| = \\sqrt{(x + jy)(x-jy)}$ or  $|z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. If you notice that this looks like the Pythagorean theorem, it's because this **is** the Pythagorean theorem! Complex numbers map perfectly onto two-dimensional vectors, and $|z|$ represents the magnitude, or distance, from the origin of the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial from [MathBitsNotebook.com](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/ComplexNumbers/CPGraphs.html) reviews graphical representations of complex numbers on the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python knows how to handle complex numbers. Read and run the code below to learn how."
